The dataset used for this research was found @ [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jannalipenkova/covid19-public-media-dataset).

## Motivation

This project was made as to the final project for the elective data science taught by Henrik StrÃ¸m.  
The authors of the dataset state their motivation as follows:

> _We are sharing this dataset to help the data community explore the non-medical impacts of Covid-19, especially in terms of the social, political, economic and technological dimensions. We also hope that this dataset will encourage more work on information-related issues such as disinformation, rumours and fake news that shape the global response to the situation._

We feel encouraged to research the media's sentiment during the Covid-19 crisis and has therefore drawn the following research question for this project.

> How has the viewpoint of mainstream media articles towards Covid-19 changed during the Pandemic?
>
> - Can an overall change in sentiment be seen?
> - Can a change in positivity or negativity within publishers be seen?
